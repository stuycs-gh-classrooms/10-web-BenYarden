  <p> Chess is a game with the goal of "checkmating" your opponents king based on tactical movement of all your pieces. Its oftentimes seen in popular culture as a creative and strategic game that resembles real war strategy, however it is usually played based on ones ability to understand and memorize patterns, openings, closings, and pieces. Learning chess starts with understanding how pieces move. </p>

    <p> The "how to play" section goes over the basic movement of pieces, along with general strategies that beginners should implement. </p>
    <p> The "chess news" section talks about recent news in the chess community, along with my general input on its significance. </p>
    <p> The "New forms of chess" section links to a few new versions of chess that I find relatively interesting. These are often played differently to normal chess, so I include some basic strategy and how games usually play out. </p>
