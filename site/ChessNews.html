<p> Magnus Carlesen, though retired world champion beats frouzja. While Frouzja did steal Carlsen's achievement of being the youngest player to hit a rating of 2800, the fact is that he has still been significantly outclassed in their previous matches. In classical games, Carlesen has won all four of their matches, and he has a considerably high ratio of wins in their more informal blitz matches. </p>

<p> Ding Liren finishes last at freestyle final. This is not too much of a surprise. While he obviously put on a show winning the championship in 2023, he recently fell ill, and seems to not have made a very strong recovery. While this is a dissapointment as he was hoping to enter the scene again at the freestyle, I'd say that it probably isn't a big deal.  </p>
