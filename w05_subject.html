<h2> How to play chess </h2>
<p> Chess is a game with the goal of "checkmating" your opponents king based on tactical movement of all your pieces. Learning chess starts with understanding how pieces move </p>
<p> pawns move forwards one square at a time. They can move forward two if they have not yet moved. They can capture one unit forwards diagonally. </p>
<p> Rooks can move on any square horizontally or vertically </p>
<p> Knights move in an L shape going two squares vertically or horizontally, then one unit </p>
<p> Bishops move similar to rooks, but diagonally. They can't switch squares, meaning a bishop that starts on a white square will never access a black one </P>
<p> Queens can move as either a bishop or rook </p>
<p> Kings can move one square in any direction. They can not move to a square that is attacked by a piece from the other side.
